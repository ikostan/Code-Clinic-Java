# About Code Clinic

## Code Clinic is a monthly course where a unique problem is introduced to a collection of lynda.com authors. In response, each author will create a solution using the programming language of their choice. You could learn several things from Code Clinic. Different approaches to solving a problem, the pros and cons of different languages, and some tips and tricks to incorporate into your own coding practices.

## In this example I will work on a problem in statistical analysis, and to some extent in handling big data.

## It's common to use a computer to manipulate and summarize large amounts of information. Providing important insights on how to improve or handle a situation. In this problem, we'll use weather data collected by the US Navy, from Lake Pend Oreille, in northern Idaho. As part of that testing, the US Navy compiles an exhaustive list of weather statistics, including wind speed, air temperature, and barometric pressure.

## You can browse this data by pointing your web browser at lpo.dt.navy.mil.
